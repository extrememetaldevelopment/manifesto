# Extreme Metal Development

## The Manifesto

    [e\m/d]
    You put on a good pair of headphones.  
    You listen to some fucking death metal.  
    You crank up the volume until people around you can hear a constant background noise.  
    You open your favourite editor and You get your shit done!  
    Period!
    


## from wikipedia:
> Extreme Metal Development (e\m/d) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.  
> As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.    
> Other elements of extreme metal programming include: listening to metal music loudly, pair programming either you and yourself or you and Satan based upon the kind of music you're listening to, brutal code review and mistreating of bad code authors', continuous quality check of your colleagues music tastes (mistreat them if they fail), unit testing of code just when you need and feeling to and Satan is ok with, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed (who cares), continuous swearing, continuous headbanging, no management structure, well-crafted code, expecting changes in the customer's requirements since clients never have a clear idea of what they want, morons.   
> The methodology takes its name from a Morbid Angel t-shirt: **Extreme music for extreme programmers**.



## Variations

- **Epic/Power Metal Development**: it involves coming to the office with swords and dragons, unpractical.
- **Prog/Math Metal Development**: hipsters trying to convince people Myung is the best player ever lived and javascript is good.
- **Alt/Nu Metal Development**: not programming, like it is not metal.


## Join us
You can use this methodology by simply following its manifesto or you can brag about it (we like it) by using the emblem `e\m/d` in your code comments like this:

`# loudly coded in [e\m/d]`



## Getting Started
- **Music**
    - **Beginner**: Testament, Sodom, The Crown, Dark Tranquillity ...   
    - **Pro**: Marduk, Dissection, Cryptopsy, Anaal Nathrakh, Atheist ...
